First select 'insert a picture' on the left-hand side.
 If you need to select a foreground, you can choose one. 
Right now the program only supports selecting a foreground. 
Then select 'vanishing point' and 'Inner Recktangle select', to build the 12 points needed to segment the image. 
Then the next step is to select 'Build 3D Model', this step is essential because it implements the process of conversion from 2D to 3D. 
Next, select the angle you want to rotate, in this process you can choose between horizontal and vertical rotation. 
Next select the image resolution, here you should note that the higher the resolution, the longer the image will take to render, 
even 'low resolution' will take 6 minutes to run. Finally click 'confirm'.

Tips:If you want to change inner recktangle after building a 3D model, please press Build 3D Model again after press Redefine Inner Recktangle

Necessary Toolbox: we don't use Toolbox, just fudnamental function
